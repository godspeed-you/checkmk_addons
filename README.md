# checkmk_addons

This repository should contain all my ideas and concepts adressing the very cool monitoring software check**mk**. I try to add to make transparent which parts are in a very experimental state or and which I do consider as usable (or even *stable*). 

List of subprojects:
* [Oracle on Windows](README_mk_oracle_win.md):
  * The idea is to write a new integration for Oracle in Windows based on Powershell and the usage of the shipped libraries by Oracle. At the moment it's kind of working... in some cases. 
  * Currently open problem is to forward the SQL queries to the API of Oracle without changing the original queries of the mk_oracle for Linux/AIX. The current code is only able to execute a single command and not a whole group of them. 
* [Special Agent for Fritz!Box](README_agent_fritzbox.md):
  * There is a very good module for the API of fritzbox devices called [fritzconnection](https://github.com/lukasklein/fritzconnection). The reworked agent does make use of that module and fetches a lot more information than the old implementation.
  * Currenty I added two very basic check plugins for the agent and the support is for the unreleased check**mk** version only.
  * You need to install fritzconnection as site user, to use this plugin: `pip install fritzconnection` - See the specific README for more information.
* [Monitoring of current Logins](README_mk_logins.md):
  * The regular checking is not sufficient enough. On some systems you may want to allow/deny specific origins from which it is allow to log in or users that are allowed to log in. Also a time specific mesearement is possible. This extension should handle these use cases in a first draft.
  * Currently open is the requirement to allow specific users of specific origins for a specific amount of time. Or vice versa. But that's complicated...
* [Notifcation via telegram](README_telegram):
  * There are several telegram extensions out there - And I was not completely happy with any of them. This one is using the latest improvements of Checkmk 2.0.0 so the extension itself is quite small. 
  * Currently not possible to modify the notification body on the web interface itself. Simply because I don't need it...
  * Currently not possible to ackn an event through telegram itself. Only had some ideas about a possible architecture...
* [Export Dashboards for sharing](README_dashboard_exporter):
  * You may want to share your Dashboards with other users. Or you want to distribute some Dashboards to other Checkmk instances without having them strictly connected with an user. So these two exporters allow to move your custom dashboards into the local file structure of Checkmk. With that you may create one ore more MKPs.
  * Known builtin Dashboards (such as 'main' or 'problems') are ignored by default.
  * The apache restart is done automatically with option -a.
  * Currently it is not possible to automatically create an MKP out out your exported dashboards.
  * There is no validation at all, if an exported dashboard is compatible to a different version of Checkmk.
